## Description
We are **Character Coders** and as fans of media - Movies, TV Shows, actors, directors and more, we wanted a quick and easy way to find out up-to-date information about our favorite media.

How often are you watching a show and see an actor that looks SO familiar, but you can’t quite place where you’ve seen them before? This happens to me ALL THE TIME! With our the Character Coder Entertainment Search, it’s easy to look up the show or movie you are watching, get a cast list, use that cast list to link to actor profiles that show other cast and crew edits, and so much more!

Watch trailers, season Season and Episode breakdowns, and even see how and where you can stream a show or movie!

The Character Coder Entertainment Search is your one-stop-shop for Movie, TV Show and actor information!
